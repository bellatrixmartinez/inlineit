%h1 Inlineit. A simple css inline web service

%h2 The Scenario: 
%p I found myself in several situations where:
%ul
  %li I sliced a PSD using external css to inline it later.
  %li I was tired os copying and pasting the same css class in several places.
  %li I just wanted to worry about the inline css later.

%b inlineit.heroku.com is here to help you.

%h2 How:
%p Just use the form at the top of this page. Is as simple as that. After you submit, we'll inline it for you. 
%p Maybe you want to post to inlineit.heroku.com/work with :html and :css ?
